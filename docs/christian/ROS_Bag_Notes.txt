ROS Bag Notes

ROS bag can be used to collect and record raw data (i.e. raw camera image data) 
and replay that same data over again.

This is very useful for testing and debugging the functionality of a system we
are building.

For example, we can move our RC car with an attached Intel Realsense D435i and record
the data produced by the camera. The data the camera can produce is color images,
depth images, and IMU data. We can record as we drive around and simply replay this
data as input data going into our SLAM system and have our system produce a map
from this recorded raw data. This means if our system does not work well or as
expected, we can simply make improvements and fixes to our system then replay
the recorded data and we should see a much more accurate map or a map that we
expect versus having to run the RC car physically everytime we want to test our
system. Having to physically run our car everytime at the beginning stage of
our development is going to be very time consuming and make it that much more
difficult to debug our system. What if the issue is with our robot itself and not
our software? With this we can build our SLAM system independently of the robot
that will actually be running our system.

Example of recording the turtlesim pose topic
----------------------------------------------
ros2 bag record /turtle1/pose -o mybagOutputFolder

Getting information on the bag directory
---------------------------------------------
ros2 bag info mybagOutputFolder
*note that in this case we are in the parent directory of mybagOutputFolder
 it does not magically find this directory for us.
 
 Play bag
 --------------
 ros2 bag play mybagOutputFolder
 * not all topics will move the turtlesim. pose does not move it. We need
 to record /turtle1/cmd_vel in order to see the turtle move on playback
