Jetson Nano Configurations and Packages
------------------------------------------
TLDR:
Main point here is that there are 2 rtabmaps installed on jetson nano.
Running on rtabmap upons opening the container will use the older rtabmap
but will output a lot of different topics such as pointcloud maps.
To use the newer rtabmap you go to ~/dev_ws and run source install/local_setup.bash
and then run rtabmap. This will be a newer version of rtabmap but right now seems to only 
output local odometry topics. Needs to get configured to output other topics.


Here I explain the various configurations possible for using jetson nano for slam.
There have been a lot of changes to the jeston nano packages and there can be a lot
of confusion for what packages are running.

Base Docker ROS 2 Foxy SLAM Container from DustyNV of Nvidia
--------------------------------------------------------------
This container has realsense-ros and rtabmap installed by default.
The version of rtab map here is an older version but should still work.
In order for it to work though we must install the imu_madwick_filter package
to provide IMU messages to rtabmap.
