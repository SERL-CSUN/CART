Installing rtabmap for ROS2
----------------------------------
I tried installing rtabmap for ros2 with the instructions from here: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros/tree/ros2#rtabmap_ros

Was getting a cmake error due to some dependencies required by rtabmap.
To solve this issue I ran the following commands:
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src -r -y

 (This commands above assume you have rosdep installed and configured already)
 Was still getting the issue even after rosdep installed all dependencies
 
 Now it seems to be trying to install.
 I had to run the colcon build command again with the cmake args and add a new cmake
 arg for the boost library:
 -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
