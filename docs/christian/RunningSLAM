Running the below commands each in their own terminal should bring up rtabmapviz
which will then display the 3D map that it has currently constructed along with th odometry.

If the odometry screen goes red, it means that rtab map does not now the location of the camera. It
is essentially lost and will stop creating the map. To try to fix this you can slowly move back to 
the previous location and it might "find" itself again but it might not at which point you might have
to restart.
