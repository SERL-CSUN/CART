The ros2 container currently used with jetson nano uses rmw_cyclone_dds as the underlying
dds implementation for communication. For some reason this causes issues. Switching to
rmw_fastrtps_cpp yields much more reliable results. Therefore, we need to change the implementation
that the ros2 docker container uses on the jetson nano.

After running inside cart/slam container run:
- echo $RMW_IMPLEMENTATION
 
 The previous command will output what dds implementation is in use. Change it if it is not rmw_fastrtps_cpp
 
 To change run:
 - export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
 
After setting that env variable we now want to reset ros2 to use the new implementation
run:
- ros2 daemon stop

Then run:
- ros2 daemon start

Now we the communication between jetson nano and the base station should be much more reliable.
